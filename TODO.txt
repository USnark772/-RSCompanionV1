Updater:
-   Connect to server
    Query version
    if not latest version
	    Direct user to download latest version

Installer:
-   Installer would install latest version replacing any previous versions
-   Need to add new repo for consumer download target and place latest build version in it

Etc.:
-   Possibly use numpy for internal data storage
-   NEED TO output mils from block start properly for at least drt
-   Check on how saving exp name / block name is handled
-   Check on how saving a .txt per device is handled on new experiment

How to save?
-   If new exp then make new save files
-   If append exp then continue with current save files


-   Rebuild main.exe because in For_setup.controller.py it's putting the com_output.txt filepath on the block number
    label and it's not checking for updates properly. the Companion/Controller/controller.py doesn't do this with the
    filepath
