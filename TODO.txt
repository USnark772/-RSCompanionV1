GraphObj
-   Fix subplot layout issues
-   Put same type of devices in the same graph
    -   when devices have multiple outputs, use as examples

        -   https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/subplot.html
-   Design good way to calculate mean of each data type
    -   Let user set the bounds of the mean
    -   Put graph controls below each graph
-   VOG
    -   Figure out how to plot a scatter plot. Currently showing all x values as same value
-   Some unexplained issues with ui sizing (Has to do with screen scaling)

At some point:
-   Possibly use numpy for internal data storage.
-   Implement video. Begin exp starts recording video. Device overlay is recorded with the video
    Device output will add a frame # for when that device output came in
    Consider OpenCV python module
    Video output will be all one video file with possibly multiple video feeds.
-   Show/Hide device graphs at user request. Graphs can be overlayed or not, need future input.
-   GPS device integration.
-   Think about how to manage licenses ( Is this software worth protecting or is it useless without our specific devices? )


to get stack trace
-   from traceback import print_stack
    print_stack() where you want a stacktrace
