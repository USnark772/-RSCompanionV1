-   Bug check with team
-   Document code
-   Ship it

After launch:
-   Video integration
-   GPS integration

Updater:

Devices:
-   Check device/program output

Video:
-   Begin exp starts recording video. Device overlay is recorded with the video
    Device output will add a frame # for when that device output came in
    Consider OpenCV python module
    Video output will be all one video file with possibly multiple video feeds.

Graphing:
-   Design good way to calculate mean of each data type (don't worry about this for now)
    -   Let user set the bounds of the mean
    -   Put graph controls below each graph

TODO: fix these issues
-   Check for updates is not working again. Possibly due to repository being private
-   When scrolling, the graphs move in their canvasas (don't worry about this for now)
-   Some unexplained issues with ui sizing (Has to do with screen scaling) (don't worry about this for now)

At some point:
-   Possibly use numpy for internal data storage. (don't worry about this for now)
-   GPS device integration.
-   Think about how to manage licenses ( Is this software worth protecting or is it useless without our specific devices? )

to get stack trace
-   from traceback import print_stack
    print_stack() where you want a stacktrace
