Updater:
-   Connect to server
    Query version
    if not latest version
	    Direct user to download latest version
-   Automatically download latest version at users request

Installer:
-   Installer would install latest version replacing any previous versions

Etc.:
-   Finish implementing graphing
    -   Add scrollbar handler logic (see matplot_example_three.py)
    -   Pipe data through device controllers to graph
-   Some unexplained issues with ui sizing

At some point:
-   Possibly use numpy for internal data storage.
-   Implement video. Begin exp starts recording video. Device overlay is recorded with the video
    Device output will add a frame # for when that device output came in
    Consider OpenCV python module
    Video output will be all one video file with possibly multiple video feeds.
-   Automatically check for updates at startup if user selects that option
-   Show/Hide device graphs at user request. Graphs can be overlayed or not, need future input.
-   GPS device integration.
