Updater:
-   Connect to server
    Query version
    if not latest version
	    Direct user to download latest version
-   Update is available, download now? if yes, don't make user go find it.
-   figure out why with builds it's not checking for updates properly.

Installer:
-   Installer would install latest version replacing any previous versions
-   Need to add new repo for consumer download target and place latest build version in it

Etc.:
-   Make sure vog is outputting properly
-   Reimplement current use of Qt.Charts for graphing. Figure out matplotlib later
-   x axis needs to be timestamp

At some point:
-   Change to matplotlib for graphing.
-   Possibly use numpy for internal data storage.
