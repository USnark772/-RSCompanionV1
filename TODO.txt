Devices:
-   Check device/program output

Graphing:
-   Show/Hide device data in each graph at user request. DONE
-   Show/Hide device graphs at user request. DONE
-   Design good way to calculate mean of each data type
    -   Let user set the bounds of the mean
    -   Put graph controls below each graph

TODO: fix these issues
-   Error when attaching a device where in device_manager.py __attach_devices() a SerialException is raised
    -   FIXED WITH A TIMER AND RETRYING CONNECTION
-   When the tab indices get mixed up and removing devices sometimes the wrong tab gets deleted
    -   FIXED BY USING COM PORT AS IDENTITY FOR DEVICES IN TAB CONTAINER
-   Some unexplained issues with ui sizing (Has to do with screen scaling)

At some point:
-   Possibly use numpy for internal data storage.
-   Implement video. Begin exp starts recording video. Device overlay is recorded with the video
    Device output will add a frame # for when that device output came in
    Consider OpenCV python module
    Video output will be all one video file with possibly multiple video feeds.
-   GPS device integration.
-   Think about how to manage licenses ( Is this software worth protecting or is it useless without our specific devices? )

to get stack trace
-   from traceback import print_stack
    print_stack() where you want a stacktrace
