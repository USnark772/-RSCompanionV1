TODO:
-   Figure out why it could be crashing when making the device controllers if the devices are unable to talk with the
    program.
-   Implement error handling on everything and make it output to an error log.
-   Bug check with team
-   Ship it

After launch:
-   Should we add a way to see app version under the help option?
-   Video integration (OpenCV? Might have some fps issues, some talk about using pygame.)
    Seems to have trouble accessing USB camera. Uses builtin webcams just fine. Need to do more searching.
    It seems Qt5 has a good implementation so far. Preliminary research shows there is a way to overlay. Consider using
    https://developer.ridgerun.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gstreamer_QT_Overlay for overlay but do more research.
-   GPS integration

Updater:
-   Automatically download latest version at users request
-   Automatically check for updates at startup if user selects that option

Installer: Inno Setup
-   Make sure installer installs over previous versions of Companion app

Devices:
-   Check device/program output

Video:
-   Begin exp starts recording video. Device overlay is recorded with the video
    Device output will add a frame # for when that device output came in
    Consider OpenCV python module
    Video output will be all one video file with possibly multiple video feeds.
    Try for multiple feeds at the same time.

Graphing:
-   Design good way to calculate mean of each data type (don't worry about this for now)
    -   Let user set the bounds of the mean
    -   Put graph controls below each graph

TODO: fix these issues
-   Check for updates is not working again. Possibly due to repository being private
-   When scrolling, the graphs move in their canvasas (don't worry about this for now)
-   Some unexplained issues with ui sizing (Has to do with screen scaling) (don't worry about this for now)

At some point:
-   Possibly use numpy for internal data storage. (don't worry about this for now)
-   GPS device integration.
-   Think about how to manage licenses ( Is this software worth protecting or is it useless without our specific devices? )

to get stack trace
-   from traceback import print_stack
    print_stack() where you want a stacktrace
to get exceptions
-   from traceback import print_exc
    print_exc(filename)
