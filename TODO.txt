Updater:
-   Connect to server
    Query version
    if not latest version
	    Direct user to download latest version

Installer:
-   Installer would install latest version replacing any previous versions
-   Need to add new repo for consumer download target and place latest build version in it

Etc.:
-   Check on how saving exp name is handled
-   When saving a line, if not exp name put in a blank
-   If new exp then make new save files
-   Change save location of output file
-   Change default save location of save files
-   Update is available, download now? if yes, don't make user go find it.
-   Check to make sure output from drt and vog are similar to output from old version of gui.

-   Rebuild main.exe because it's not checking for updates properly.


Design:
-   Experiment frame with two buttons and one textentry for ~CONDITION NAME~,
-   One button on left is smaller and create/close exp, other button is for block start/stop
-   Removing block name entirely
-   When posting a note ( call it post ) reset text box to empty
-   Resize of config menus shall be not happening in height, but width may change as needed
-   config fields be changed to text entries instead of sliders.


At some point:
-   Refactor code.
-   Change to matplotlib for graphing.
-   Possibly use numpy for internal data storage.
-   x axis label needs to be timestamp
